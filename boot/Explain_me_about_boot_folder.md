## Explain me about boot folder

The `/boot` directory in Linux is **crucial for the system startup process**. It contains all the files and data needed to **boot the operating system** — essentially, it's the first stop after your BIOS/UEFI hands over control to Linux.

---

### 📁 What Is the `/boot` Directory?

* The `/boot` folder contains **kernel and bootloader files**.
* These files are required **before** the main Linux system (root `/`) is fully loaded.
* Without `/boot`, your system **won’t boot** properly.

### 🧱 Contents of `/boot`

Here’s what you’ll typically find:

| File/Folder                     | Purpose                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `vmlinuz-*`                     | The **compressed Linux kernel image** (vmlinuz = Virtual Memory LINUx gZip). This is the actual operating system kernel. |
| `initrd.img-*` or `initramfs-*` | The **initial RAM filesystem** used to preload necessary drivers and files before the real root filesystem is mounted.   |
| `config-*`                      | Configuration file used to build the specific kernel version.                                                            |
| `System.map-*`                  | Symbol table for debugging and tracking kernel functions (used by developers or tools like `kexec`).                     |
| `grub/` or `grub2/`             | The **GRUB bootloader directory**, containing config files (`grub.cfg`), themes, and modules.                            |

> The filenames often include the kernel version, e.g., `vmlinuz-5.15.0-92-generic`.

### 🔁 Boot Process Involving `/boot`

1. **BIOS/UEFI** starts and hands off to the bootloader (e.g., GRUB).
2. **GRUB (in `/boot/grub`)** loads the kernel (`vmlinuz`) and `initrd` from `/boot`.
3. The kernel initializes hardware and mounts the real root filesystem (`/`).
4. The rest of the Linux system boots up.

### 💡 Why Keep `/boot` Separate?

Sometimes `/boot` is put on a **separate partition**. Here's why:

| Reason              | Explanation                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧱 BIOS limitations | Older BIOS systems can't read beyond certain disk sectors (past 2 TB or unsupported filesystems).                                   |
| 🔒 Security         | `/boot` can be made read-only or signed to protect against tampering (Secure Boot).                                                 |
| 🧰 Recovery         | If your root filesystem is encrypted (e.g., LUKS), `/boot` must remain unencrypted so the system can find the kernel and initramfs. |

---

### 📌 Important Notes

* Do **not delete or modify** files in `/boot` unless you’re managing kernels or the bootloader intentionally.
* When you install a new kernel (via updates), a new `vmlinuz`, `initrd`, and config file are added to `/boot`.
* Use tools like `update-grub`, `grub-install`, or `grubby` (depending on distro) to update the GRUB config properly.

### ✅ Example of `/boot` Directory (Ubuntu)

```bash
$ ls /boot

vmlinuz-5.15.0-92-generic
initrd.img-5.15.0-92-generic
grub/
System.map-5.15.0-92-generic
config-5.15.0-92-generic
```
